          <h2>LUXURY</h2>
          <p>
            A luxury car is a car that provides increased levels of comfort,
            equipment, amenities, quality, performance, and associated status
            compared to moderately priced cars. The term is subjective and
            reflects both the qualities of the car and the brand image of its
            manufacturer.Luxury brands rank above premium brands, though
            there is no fixed demarcation between the two.Traditionally,
            most luxury cars were large vehicles, though smaller sports-oriented
            models were always produced. "Compact" luxury vehicles such as
            hatchbacks, and off-road capable sport utility vehicles, are
            relatively modern trends.
