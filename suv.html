          <h2>SUVS</h2>
          <p>
            A sport utility vehicle (SUV) is a car classification that combines
            elements of road-going passenger cars with features from off-road
            vehicles, such as raised ground clearance and four-wheel drive.
            There is no commonly agreed-upon definition of an SUV and usage of
            the term varies between countries. Thus, it is "a loose term that
            traditionally covers a broad range of vehicles with four-wheel
            drive."Some definitions claim that an SUV must be built on a light
            truck chassis; however, broader definitions consider any vehicle
            with off-road design features to be an SUV. A crossover SUV is often
            defined as an SUV built with a unibody construction (as with
            passenger cars), however, the designations are increasingly blurred
            because of the capabilities of the vehicles, the labelling by
            marketers, and electrification of new models.The predecessors to
            SUVs date back to military and low-volume models from the late
            1930s, and the four-wheel drive station wagons and carryalls that
            began to be introduced in 1949. The 1984 Jeep Cherokee (XJ) is
            considered to be the first SUV in the modern style.Some SUVs
            produced today use unibody construction; however, in the past, more
            SUVs used body-on-frame construction. During the late 1990s and
            early 2000s, the popularity of SUVs greatly increased, often at the
            expense of the popularity of large sedans and station wagons.
