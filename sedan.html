          <h2>SEDANS</h2>
          <p>
            A sedan is a car with a closed body (i.e. a fixed metal
            roof) with the engine, passengers, and cargo in separate
            compartments.This broad definition does not differentiate sedans
            from various other car body styles, but in practice, the typical
            characteristics of sedans are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    a B-pillar (between the front and rear windows) that supports the roof
                </li>
                <li>
                    two rows of seats
                </li>
                <li>
                    three-box design with the engine at the front and the cargo area at the rear
                </li>
                <li>
                    a less steeply sloping roofline than a coupé, which results in increased headroom for rear passengers and a less
                    sporting appearance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    a rear interior volume of at least 33 cu ft (0.93 m3)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            It is sometimes suggested that sedans must have
            four doors (to provide a simple distinction between sedans and
            two-door coupés).<br>
            However, several sources state that a sedan
            can have two or four doors.In addition, terms such
            as sedan and coupé have been more loosely interpreted by car
            manufacturers since 2010.
            <br><br>When a manufacturer produces two-door
            sedan and four-door sedan versions of the same model, the shape and
            position of the greenhouse on both versions may be identical, with
            only the B-pillar positioned further back to accommodate the longer
            doors on the two-door versions.
